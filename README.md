# About
This crate contains rules for parsing the OpenGEX format. The data will be stored in structures that interfacing applications can read from. 

## OpenGEX
The Open Game Engine Exchange (OpenGEX) format is a text-based file format for transferring scenes between applications, for example game engines and moddeling tools. The format was specifically designed with game engines in mind. More information, like the specification, can be found on the format's [official webpage](http://opengex.org/).
